# SNN-Audio-Denoising

This project aims to recreate the Spiking FullSubNet network architecture proposed in this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10605482.
While the source code for this report is now available here: https://github.com/haoxiangsnr/spiking-fullsubnet, it was released a majority of the way through the recreation process and did not influence our attempted model. However, the official Spiking FullSubNet codebase was used for additional exploration into design practices for smaller training sets than what is used in the above paper.
